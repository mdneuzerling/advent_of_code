# Advent of Code puzzle solutions

These are my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

AOC2021 solutions are written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). I'm still a beginner of Julia --- my usual language of choice is R, and occasionally Python. View more of my work at my blog, [mdneuzerling.com](https://mdneuzerling.com).

AOC2022 solutions are in Rust.
